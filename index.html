            <h2 id="Playing" class="Playing__h2 h2">How To Play</h2>
            <p class="Playing__p p">To play Worldle you just search https://worldle.teuteuf.fr/.</p>
            <p class="playing__after after">After that you should see a screen that shows an outline of a country, a textbox that is used to guess, a guess button, and boxes that will show your past guesses. To start playing you should look at the outline and guess a country. Let's say you guess Mali. It will show the name of the country you guessed, how far away your guess is from the actuall country, an arrow pointing in which direction the country is, and the percentage of how close you where(If you where very close it should be a high percentage). After that you now have clues to use up your 5 guesses that you have left. Good Luck!</p>

            <h2 id="Needs/Wants" class="needs__h2 h2">Needs/Wants</h2>
            <p class="needs__p p">What do you want/need to know to succeed almost/everytime. First you need to know the shape of a country orelse you would be randomly guessing and it would turn into a game of luck. Another thing you might need is to know where the countries are so that you can know which countries are left. You will need to know how far away a country is from another country, but you don't really need it. You will need to know things for after you get the answer. After you get the answer you will need to know, You will need to know some fun facts like: Neighbors, capital city, flag, area, top 2 spoken languages, population and currency, and top 4 populous cities in order.</p>

            <h2 id="Good" class="good__h2 h2">Why It's Good For You</h2>
            <p class="good__p p">It is very good for you because you can get to know the countries very well. You might want to play atleast one game per week to know and memorize the things that the country has(Like the looks of the country and the fun facts). You will become a world wiz and might want to teach other people about it by making a youtube channel(Like what I did before I got to busy). You probably will be known by lots of people in a good way that you are a "World Wiz". You'r parents will be very proud that their child is ver good at knowing the countries very well.</p>

            <p class="talk__p p">You might be still wondering why I created this website to talk about Worldle. As I said in this website there are a few reasons why it's good for you to play. If you want to go back to that part.</p>
